  instructions: "Preheat oven to 375F\nMix dry ingredients together.  Gently beat eggs together before adding to dry mixture.  Add oil.  (I had my coconut oil in a mixing cup and added the eggs to mix together but the coldness of the eggs turned the oil solid, it was difficult to mix the solid oil in the batter.\nAdd water a little at a time until you get the desired consistency to pour thickly into your loaf pan.\nI used a Pyrex bread pan with parchment paper, cooked at 375F for 40 mins.  If you use a metal pan you will have to adjust time.",
